# Elements of Mercury

An interactive slide deck for my CampJS V presentation on [mercury](https://github.com/Raynos/mercury), which also serves as an example mercury app.

# Getting started

    $ npm install
    $ npm run dev

This will build the project, start a local server, then watch for local changes.

Have a look at the `scripts` in `package.json` for more dev/build/dist options.

To advance slides, use the right key, enter key or spacebar. To go back, press the left key. On touchscreens, swipe left and right to navigate. If you press escape, you can toggle the settings pane, this lets you change the slide transition theme, and whether demos show their state diff logs.

Slide content is in `src/scripts/slides/content.js`.
